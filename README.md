#The Supermarket Sales Dashboard using Power BI 🛒📊

###🌟 Welcome to the Supermarket Sales Power BI Dashboard Project!

This project focuses on extracting actionable business insights from supermarket sales data using Power BI, enabling better decision-making across sales, products, customers, and branches.

###Project Overview

Using Power BI’s data modeling and visualization capabilities, this dashboard analyzes supermarket performance across multiple dimensions, including:

Sales and profitability trends

Branch-wise performance
